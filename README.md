# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
This is an application that demonstrates backend functionality of a basic commerce store. The store has items 
such as clothes, sporting gear (basketball, vinyl records, etc.). The assignment here for this challenge was to
get all the routes working for Products, Categories, and Tags. Each of these 3 had their own 5 backend routes:
GET all, GET single, ADD item, UPDATE item, and DELETE item. The functionality of these 5 routes is demonstrated
for each 3 areas in the following 2 videos. Part 1 shows the setup and configuration of database, and the routes 
for the categories. Part 2 shows the routes for the products and tags.
